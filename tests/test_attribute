title: Evaluation of DrugX for Long-term Safety and Efficacy in Hypertension Management
sponsor: PharmaCorp International
protocol_number: PC-HT-2024-001
registry_number: NCT01234567
principal_investigator: Dr. John Smith, MD, PhD
study_sites: New York General Hospital, Chicago Medical Center, Los Angeles Clinical Research Facility
drug_name: DrugX
rationale: To assess the long-term effects of DrugX in managing hypertension in a diverse population.
preclinical_data: Extensive animal studies have shown that DrugX effectively reduces blood pressure with minimal adverse effects.
dose_rationale: Based on prior studies, the dose range has been set at 50-100mg daily to maintain therapeutic efficacy.
primary_objective: To evaluate the safety profile of DrugX in long-term use.
secondary_objectives: To assess the efficacy of DrugX in sustained blood pressure control over a 12-month period.
primary_endpoint: Incidence of major cardiovascular adverse events.
secondary_endpoints: Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline, incidence of minor adverse events.
trial_phase: Phase 4
study_design: Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study.
dose_escalation_strategy: Dose adjustments based on patient response and tolerance, capped at 100mg daily.
stopping_rules: Trial will be stopped if >10% of participants experience severe adverse events.
study_duration: 12 months of treatment, with a 6-month follow-up period.
inclusion_criteria: Adults aged 18-75 with diagnosed hypertension.
exclusion_criteria: Individuals with a history of stroke, heart failure, or renal impairment.
num_participants: 500
study_location: United States
safety_monitoring_plan: Monthly safety reviews by an independent monitoring board.
risk_considerations: Potential risk of dizziness and hypotension due to blood pressure lowering effects.
adverse_event_reporting: All adverse events to be reported to the FDA within 15 days.
stopping_criteria: Protocol-specific stopping rules for individual patients with adverse reactions.
statistical_methods: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression for hazard ratios.
sample_size_justification: Based on an estimated 5% annual adverse event rate, 500 participants provide 80% power.
missing_data_handling: Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for missing blood pressure data.
data_collection_methods: Electronic health records, patient diaries, and in-clinic assessments.
confidentiality_plan: Data anonymization and restricted access through secured servers.
data_access: Data accessible only to study investigators and authorized personnel.
ethics_committee_approval: Approved by Institutional Review Boards at all study sites.
informed_consent: Written informed consent obtained from all participants before study initiation.
