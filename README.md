# AutoProtocol: Clinical Trial Document Generator

## Overview
AutoProtocol is an AI-powered platform designed to streamline the creation of clinical trial documents. By leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs) and automation, AutoProtocol enables clinical trial teams to generate professional, high-quality protocol documents in a fraction of the time. The platform simplifies and accelerates the traditionally manual and time-intensive process of clinical trial protocol development.

## Key Features
- **AI-Driven Document Generation**: Utilizes LLMs like OpenAI's GPT and Claude to create detailed, professional clinical trial documents.
- **Dynamic Templates**: Supports multiple clinical trial types (e.g., Phase I, Phase II, Phase III), allowing users to generate protocols tailored to specific trial requirements.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Accepts user-defined attributes (e.g., trial title, drug name, sponsor details) to generate personalized documents.
- **Iterative Content Review**: Allows users to review, edit, and save individual document sections directly in the browser as they are generated.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Supports integration with cloud storage (S3), search (OpenSearch for RAG), and databases for enhanced document management.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Enables teams to work together to refine and finalize protocol documents.
- **Output Formats**: Generates documents in multiple formats, including markdown, Word, and PDF.

## Architecture
### Frontend
- Built with **React**, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.
- Key Features:
  - User-friendly forms for input collection.
  - Real-time preview of generated protocol sections.
  - Integration with APIs for seamless communication with the backend.

### Backend
- Developed using **FastAPI**, ensuring fast and reliable performance.
- Key Components:
  - **LLM Integration**: Calls to OpenAI and Claude for document generation.
  - **Data Storage**: Uses S3 for document storage and retrieval.
  - **Search and Retrieval**: Employs OpenSearch for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
  - **User Management**: Authentication and authorization for secure access.

## Workflow
1. **Input Collection**: Users enter clinical trial details via the frontend forms.
2. **Template Selection**: The platform selects the appropriate template based on trial type and phase.
3. **AI Generation**: The backend uses the input data and templates to generate document sections with the help of LLMs.
4. **Review and Edit**: Users can review, edit, and approve individual sections in real-time.
5. **Final Document Creation**: The platform compiles the approved sections into a complete, downloadable document.

## Deployment
### Current Setup
- **Frontend**: Hosted on **Vercel**.
- **Backend**: Deployed via **Render**, integrated with S3 and OpenSearch.

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to the AutoProtocol website.
2. Select the trial type and phase.
3. Fill out the required input fields (e.g., trial title, sponsor details, drug name).
4. Submit the inputs to generate the protocol sections.
5. Review and edit the generated sections as needed.
6. Download the completed document in your preferred format.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced LLM Training**: Fine-tune LLMs with real-world clinical trial documents for improved accuracy.
- **Advanced Collaboration Tools**: Enable real-time multi-user editing.
- **Version Control**: Add features for tracking document revisions.
- **Mobile Support**: Build a mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go editing.
- **Monetization**: Introduce subscription-based plans for premium features.
